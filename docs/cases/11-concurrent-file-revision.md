# C11 · Concurrent file revision

Reject a candidate made stale by an actual concurrent file writer, refresh and rebase, then write the intended next revision. The writer is a controlled thread scheduled after candidate binding and before native admission.

## Initial state and inputs

`shared.json` initially contains `{revision: 1, value: seed}` and `expected_revision=1`. On the first `cas_write` attempt, a separate thread writes `{revision: 2, value: seed + 100}` and joins before the runtime re-observes resources. Native and document-level revisions remain separate.

All cases expose the shared preparation operations `refresh`, `ack_event`, and `wait_dependency`. Candidate order is shuffled reproducibly by seed and step. The default episode limit is 16 transitions. The native journal directory is excluded from workload fingerprints; separate event-transport files do not cause accidental stale rejection during a readiness wait.

## Registered actions and expected control

| Operation | Actual behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `rebase` | Reads actual shared JSON, copies its revision to `expected_revision`, and clears `conflict`. |
| `cas_write` | Reads the current file again, compares its document revision with the expected value, and writes `{revision: 3, value: seed + 1}` only if they agree. |
| `report` | Distractor with no applicable C11 effect. |

A supported nominal sequence is **cas_write (native stale rejection) → refresh → rebase → cas_write**. This is an inspectable M01 rule sequence, not a claimed learned discovery. Native admission checks trusted registration, capability, resource scope and current binding before effects. Most fixture operations hold a conservative `workspace` write lease.

## Independent outcome truth

The verifier requires exact parsed JSON `{revision: 3, value: seed + 1}`. Clearing `conflict` does not complete the task. Native admission separately checks the current resource fingerprint and resource version before calling the effect handler.

At seed 40000, the final shared document is exactly `{revision: 3, value: 40001}`.

## Six variants as implemented

| Variant | Actual mechanism and required response |
| --- | --- |
| `nominal` | The family-specific initial condition described above. Nominal does not imply a fault-free workload: recovery families deliberately include their named fault. |
| `delayed_observation` | After the first observation, an independent producer waits 15 ms and atomically publishes source sequence 2 to `.scenario/delivery.json`. `refresh` waits at most 250 ms for that actual file, reads it, and clears the stale-state gate. Delivery availability invalidates the cached observation. |
| `duplicate_event` | The inbox contains two records with the same delivery ID. `ack_event` consumes both into a persistent dedup ledger with one accepted ID and one duplicate, then feeds the same event twice to the native reducer and records `duplicate=true`. Repeating acknowledgment does not add an accepted event or execute the family effect twice. |
| `stale_conflict` | A separate writer changes `.scenario/revision.json` after the candidate has been bound and before native dispatch. The actual fingerprint change causes `stale_revision`; no family effector executes on that first attempt. Refresh and retry against the new binding. |
| `unavailable_dependency` | An independent producer creates `.scenario/dependency.ready` after the first observation. `wait_dependency` observes that artifact with a 250 ms bound; the action does not manufacture readiness. Other family actions remain gated until it is observed. |
| `boundary` | A real 513-byte untrusted payload is clipped to a 512-byte visible limit with explicit truncation provenance. A deliberately unsupported argument is actually rejected by registration validation; a separate `allowed=False` escape candidate cannot acquire authority. |

These are deliberately scheduled fault mechanisms over actual files, threads, processes and native admissions. They are not captured production incidents. The same family predicate is checked after preparation; clearing a fault flag cannot substitute for the requested result.

## Reproduce and inspect evidence

Install the compiled `reflexmesh` package in an isolated environment. Save this as `run_case.py`, then execute `python run_case.py`. M01 needs no trained checkpoint or model provider. The environment owns a disposable directory and cleans up its processes/services on exit.

```python
import json
from dataclasses import asdict
from reflexmesh.environments import CaseSpec, SoftwareEnvironment
from reflexmesh.policies.rules import GuardedFSMPolicy

policy = GuardedFSMPolicy()
spec = CaseSpec("C11", "nominal", 40000)
with SoftwareEnvironment(spec) as env:
    while not env.terminal:
        _, outcome = env.step(policy.predict(env.observe()))
        print(json.dumps(asdict(outcome), ensure_ascii=False))
    print(json.dumps(env.runtime.snapshot()["state"]["intents"], indent=2))
    assert env.verify(), "Actual completion predicate failed"
```

Change the variant string to any row above; use seed 40001 for a second input. To retain files, supply a newly created, empty disposable `directory=` to `SoftwareEnvironment`; it writes fixture files and must not be pointed at valuable user data.

The authenticated local workbench accepts this body at `POST /api/run`:

```json
{"case_id":"C11","method_id":"M01","variant":"nominal","seed":40000,"parameters":{"max_steps":16}}
```

Use the local bearer token and poll `GET /api/events?run_id=<returned-id>&after=0`. See [the executable API procedure](../cases.md#authenticated-local-api). A request acknowledgement is not a completed episode.

## Failure evidence and interpretation limits

The first write candidate is rejected with `stale_revision` after the real concurrent write. The source remains revision 2 until the controller refreshes and rebases. `refresh` observes preparation state; `rebase` separately reads the document revision. A later unexpected document mismatch raises `revision_conflict`.

The interleaving is intentionally scheduled and reproducible, not a trace of uncontrolled production writers. The handler's read/compare/write is not an OS-atomic compare-and-swap against arbitrary external writers. Native admission catches the tested pre-dispatch change; it does not prove linearizability or remove every filesystem TOCTOU window.

Retain failed, denied, unknown and step-limit outcomes. Native `effect_unknown` retains its lease until independent reconciliation. A task predicate, a tool receipt and a model score answer different questions.
