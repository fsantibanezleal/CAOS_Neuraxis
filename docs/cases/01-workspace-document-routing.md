# C01 · Workspace document routing

Move one known document to its declared destination and establish completion from filesystem state. The case separates a proposed routing action, native admission, and the observed result of the move.

## Initial state and inputs

Every episode creates `source.txt` containing `record-{seed}` and `input.json` containing `{value: seed % 13 + 1}`. The nominal state starts with `source_exists=1`; `destination/document.txt` does not yet exist. The destination is fixed by the trusted fixture, not supplied by model-generated path text.

All cases expose the shared preparation operations `refresh`, `ack_event`, and `wait_dependency`. Candidate order is shuffled reproducibly by seed and step. The default episode limit is 16 transitions. The native journal directory is excluded from workload fingerprints; separate event-transport files do not cause accidental stale rejection during a readiness wait.

## Registered actions and expected control

| Operation | Actual behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `move` | Creates `destination/`, then calls `source.txt.replace(destination/document.txt)`; updates visible source/destination flags. |
| `index, inspect` | Registered distractors in this family; they have no applicable C01 effect and raise an explicit error. |

A supported nominal sequence is **move**. This is an inspectable M01 rule sequence, not a claimed learned discovery. Native admission checks trusted registration, capability, resource scope and current binding before effects. Most fixture operations hold a conservative `workspace` write lease.

## Independent outcome truth

`verify()` reads `destination/document.txt`, requires exact text `record-{seed}`, and also requires the original `source.txt` to be absent. A destination flag, tool receipt, or successful native admission alone does not satisfy the predicate.

At seed 40000 the destination text is `record-40000`, with no remaining `source.txt`.

## Six variants as implemented

| Variant | Actual mechanism and required response |
| --- | --- |
| `nominal` | The family-specific initial condition described above. Nominal does not imply a fault-free workload: recovery families deliberately include their named fault. |
| `delayed_observation` | After the first observation, an independent producer waits 15 ms and atomically publishes source sequence 2 to `.scenario/delivery.json`. `refresh` waits at most 250 ms for that actual file, reads it, and clears the stale-state gate. Delivery availability invalidates the cached observation. |
| `duplicate_event` | The inbox contains two records with the same delivery ID. `ack_event` consumes both into a persistent dedup ledger with one accepted ID and one duplicate, then feeds the same event twice to the native reducer and records `duplicate=true`. Repeating acknowledgment does not add an accepted event or execute the family effect twice. |
| `stale_conflict` | A separate writer changes `.scenario/revision.json` after the candidate has been bound and before native dispatch. The actual fingerprint change causes `stale_revision`; no family effector executes on that first attempt. Refresh and retry against the new binding. |
| `unavailable_dependency` | An independent producer creates `.scenario/dependency.ready` after the first observation. `wait_dependency` observes that artifact with a 250 ms bound; the action does not manufacture readiness. Other family actions remain gated until it is observed. |
| `boundary` | A real 513-byte untrusted payload is clipped to a 512-byte visible limit with explicit truncation provenance. A deliberately unsupported argument is actually rejected by registration validation; a separate `allowed=False` escape candidate cannot acquire authority. |

These are deliberately scheduled fault mechanisms over actual files, threads, processes and native admissions. They are not captured production incidents. The same family predicate is checked after preparation; clearing a fault flag cannot substitute for the requested result.

## Reproduce and inspect evidence

Install the compiled `reflexmesh` package in an isolated environment. Save this as `run_case.py`, then execute `python run_case.py`. M01 needs no trained checkpoint or model provider. The environment owns a disposable directory and cleans up its processes/services on exit.

```python
import json
from dataclasses import asdict
from reflexmesh.environments import CaseSpec, SoftwareEnvironment
from reflexmesh.policies.rules import GuardedFSMPolicy

policy = GuardedFSMPolicy()
spec = CaseSpec("C01", "nominal", 40000)
with SoftwareEnvironment(spec) as env:
    while not env.terminal:
        _, outcome = env.step(policy.predict(env.observe()))
        print(json.dumps(asdict(outcome), ensure_ascii=False))
    print(json.dumps(env.runtime.snapshot()["state"]["intents"], indent=2))
    assert env.verify(), "Actual completion predicate failed"
```

Change the variant string to any row above; use seed 40001 for a second input. To retain files, supply a newly created, empty disposable `directory=` to `SoftwareEnvironment`; it writes fixture files and must not be pointed at valuable user data.

The authenticated local workbench accepts this body at `POST /api/run`:

```json
{"case_id":"C01","method_id":"M01","variant":"nominal","seed":40000,"parameters":{"max_steps":16}}
```

Use the local bearer token and poll `GET /api/events?run_id=<returned-id>&after=0`. See [the executable API procedure](../cases.md#authenticated-local-api). A request acknowledgement is not a completed episode.

## Failure evidence and interpretation limits

Choosing `index` or `inspect` produces `operation_has_no_applicable_effect`. A missing source produces an actual filesystem exception. Inspect the native receipt's status, the outcome error, and both paths; do not infer a successful move from `destination_exists` alone.

This is a small move within one disposable workspace. It does not exercise cross-volume copy/delete semantics, large-file transfer, synchronization services, ACL migration, or human document classification. The filesystem operation and postcondition are real, while the declared routing goal is designed.

Retain failed, denied, unknown and step-limit outcomes. Native `effect_unknown` retains its lease until independent reconciliation. A task predicate, a tool receipt and a model score answer different questions.
