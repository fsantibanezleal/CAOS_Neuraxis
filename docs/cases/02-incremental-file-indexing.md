# C02 · Incremental file indexing

Update an existing content-hash index by reusing unchanged entries, hashing changed/new files, and removing deleted entries. An independent verifier recomputes all current hashes after the incremental operation.

## Initial state and inputs

The `documents/` directory starts with two unchanged files, `changed.txt`, and `deleted.txt`. A persisted `index.json` records SHA-256, size and nanosecond modification time for each. Setup then changes one file, adds `added.txt`, and deletes `deleted.txt`; visible `index_stale=1` identifies the pending indexing task.

All cases expose the shared preparation operations `refresh`, `ack_event`, and `wait_dependency`. Candidate order is shuffled reproducibly by seed and step. The default episode limit is 16 transitions. The native journal directory is excluded from workload fingerprints; separate event-transport files do not cause accidental stale rejection during a readiness wait.

## Registered actions and expected control

| Operation | Actual behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `index` | Compares current size/mtime against each persisted entry. Reuses unchanged records, hashes only changed/new content, removes absent names, and writes both the index and `index-audit.json`. |
| `move, inspect` | Registered distractors without an applicable C02 effect. |

A supported nominal sequence is **index**. This is an inspectable M01 rule sequence, not a claimed learned discovery. Native admission checks trusted registration, capability, resource scope and current binding before effects. Most fixture operations hold a conservative `workspace` write lease.

## Independent outcome truth

`verify()` independently hashes every current document and compares the full filename/digest mapping. It additionally requires exactly the two unchanged names in `reused`, changed/added names in `content_reads`, and `deleted.txt` in `deleted`. Clearing `index_stale` or writing any nonempty index is insufficient.

Four current entries remain: two reused entries and two newly computed hashes. The audit records two content reads, two reuses, and one deletion.

## Six variants as implemented

| Variant | Actual mechanism and required response |
| --- | --- |
| `nominal` | The family-specific initial condition described above. Nominal does not imply a fault-free workload: recovery families deliberately include their named fault. |
| `delayed_observation` | After the first observation, an independent producer waits 15 ms and atomically publishes source sequence 2 to `.scenario/delivery.json`. `refresh` waits at most 250 ms for that actual file, reads it, and clears the stale-state gate. Delivery availability invalidates the cached observation. |
| `duplicate_event` | The inbox contains two records with the same delivery ID. `ack_event` consumes both into a persistent dedup ledger with one accepted ID and one duplicate, then feeds the same event twice to the native reducer and records `duplicate=true`. Repeating acknowledgment does not add an accepted event or execute the family effect twice. |
| `stale_conflict` | A separate writer changes `.scenario/revision.json` after the candidate has been bound and before native dispatch. The actual fingerprint change causes `stale_revision`; no family effector executes on that first attempt. Refresh and retry against the new binding. |
| `unavailable_dependency` | An independent producer creates `.scenario/dependency.ready` after the first observation. `wait_dependency` observes that artifact with a 250 ms bound; the action does not manufacture readiness. Other family actions remain gated until it is observed. |
| `boundary` | A real 513-byte untrusted payload is clipped to a 512-byte visible limit with explicit truncation provenance. A deliberately unsupported argument is actually rejected by registration validation; a separate `allowed=False` escape candidate cannot acquire authority. |

These are deliberately scheduled fault mechanisms over actual files, threads, processes and native admissions. They are not captured production incidents. The same family predicate is checked after preparation; clearing a fault flag cannot substitute for the requested result.

## Reproduce and inspect evidence

Install the compiled `reflexmesh` package in an isolated environment. Save this as `run_case.py`, then execute `python run_case.py`. M01 needs no trained checkpoint or model provider. The environment owns a disposable directory and cleans up its processes/services on exit.

```python
import json
from dataclasses import asdict
from reflexmesh.environments import CaseSpec, SoftwareEnvironment
from reflexmesh.policies.rules import GuardedFSMPolicy

policy = GuardedFSMPolicy()
spec = CaseSpec("C02", "nominal", 40000)
with SoftwareEnvironment(spec) as env:
    while not env.terminal:
        _, outcome = env.step(policy.predict(env.observe()))
        print(json.dumps(asdict(outcome), ensure_ascii=False))
    print(json.dumps(env.runtime.snapshot()["state"]["intents"], indent=2))
    assert env.verify(), "Actual completion predicate failed"
```

Change the variant string to any row above; use seed 40001 for a second input. To retain files, supply a newly created, empty disposable `directory=` to `SoftwareEnvironment`; it writes fixture files and must not be pointed at valuable user data.

The authenticated local workbench accepts this body at `POST /api/run`:

```json
{"case_id":"C02","method_id":"M01","variant":"nominal","seed":40000,"parameters":{"max_steps":16}}
```

Use the local bearer token and poll `GET /api/events?run_id=<returned-id>&after=0`. See [the executable API procedure](../cases.md#authenticated-local-api). A request acknowledgement is not a completed episode.

## Failure evidence and interpretation limits

A distractor raises `operation_has_no_applicable_effect`; unreadable input or malformed index content can prevent verified completion. Compare actual filenames and digests with the recorded output, rather than treating a nonempty index as success.

Invalidation trusts filesystem size and nanosecond mtime. A same-size edit with deliberately restored timestamps can defeat that assumption; this fixture does not establish hostile-filesystem change detection. The admission fingerprint and independent final verifier still read actual content, so indexing reuse is not a claim that the whole pipeline performs only two file reads. There is no filesystem watcher or scalable search service.

Retain failed, denied, unknown and step-limit outcomes. Native `effect_unknown` retains its lease until independent reconciliation. A task predicate, a tool receipt and a model score answer different questions.
