# C07 · Long job cancellation

Stop a real child process before its delayed file write occurs. Completion includes process termination and the absence of the delayed effect.

## Initial state and inputs

Setup launches an owned child that sleeps for 30 seconds and would then write `late.txt`. Visible state begins with `running=1` and `cancel_requested=1`. The timer creates a generous execution window; this case is not a microsecond cancellation deadline benchmark.

All cases expose the shared preparation operations `refresh`, `ack_event`, and `wait_dependency`. Candidate order is shuffled reproducibly by seed and step. The default episode limit is 16 transitions. The native journal directory is excluded from workload fingerprints; separate event-transport files do not cause accidental stale rejection during a readiness wait.

## Registered actions and expected control

| Operation | Actual behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `cancel` | Terminates each still-running owned child, waits up to two seconds, and sets `running=0` plus `confirmed=1`. |
| `wait, report` | Distractors without applicable C07 effects. They do not make the child complete safely. |

A supported nominal sequence is **cancel**. This is an inspectable M01 rule sequence, not a claimed learned discovery. Native admission checks trusted registration, capability, resource scope and current binding before effects. Most fixture operations hold a conservative `workspace` write lease.

## Independent outcome truth

The verifier requires a confirmation flag, every tracked child to have exited, and `late.txt` to be absent. A cancellation request without observed termination is insufficient. A file already written before cancellation cannot be undone by this predicate.

The tracked process exits and no `late.txt` appears during the admitted lifecycle. Environment cleanup closes remaining process handles.

## Six variants as implemented

| Variant | Actual mechanism and required response |
| --- | --- |
| `nominal` | The family-specific initial condition described above. Nominal does not imply a fault-free workload: recovery families deliberately include their named fault. |
| `delayed_observation` | After the first observation, an independent producer waits 15 ms and atomically publishes source sequence 2 to `.scenario/delivery.json`. `refresh` waits at most 250 ms for that actual file, reads it, and clears the stale-state gate. Delivery availability invalidates the cached observation. |
| `duplicate_event` | The inbox contains two records with the same delivery ID. `ack_event` consumes both into a persistent dedup ledger with one accepted ID and one duplicate, then feeds the same event twice to the native reducer and records `duplicate=true`. Repeating acknowledgment does not add an accepted event or execute the family effect twice. |
| `stale_conflict` | A separate writer changes `.scenario/revision.json` after the candidate has been bound and before native dispatch. The actual fingerprint change causes `stale_revision`; no family effector executes on that first attempt. Refresh and retry against the new binding. |
| `unavailable_dependency` | An independent producer creates `.scenario/dependency.ready` after the first observation. `wait_dependency` observes that artifact with a 250 ms bound; the action does not manufacture readiness. Other family actions remain gated until it is observed. |
| `boundary` | A real 513-byte untrusted payload is clipped to a 512-byte visible limit with explicit truncation provenance. A deliberately unsupported argument is actually rejected by registration validation; a separate `allowed=False` escape candidate cannot acquire authority. |

These are deliberately scheduled fault mechanisms over actual files, threads, processes and native admissions. They are not captured production incidents. The same family predicate is checked after preparation; clearing a fault flag cannot substitute for the requested result.

## Reproduce and inspect evidence

Install the compiled `reflexmesh` package in an isolated environment. Save this as `run_case.py`, then execute `python run_case.py`. M01 needs no trained checkpoint or model provider. The environment owns a disposable directory and cleans up its processes/services on exit.

```python
import json
from dataclasses import asdict
from reflexmesh.environments import CaseSpec, SoftwareEnvironment
from reflexmesh.policies.rules import GuardedFSMPolicy

policy = GuardedFSMPolicy()
spec = CaseSpec("C07", "nominal", 40000)
with SoftwareEnvironment(spec) as env:
    while not env.terminal:
        _, outcome = env.step(policy.predict(env.observe()))
        print(json.dumps(asdict(outcome), ensure_ascii=False))
    print(json.dumps(env.runtime.snapshot()["state"]["intents"], indent=2))
    assert env.verify(), "Actual completion predicate failed"
```

Change the variant string to any row above; use seed 40001 for a second input. To retain files, supply a newly created, empty disposable `directory=` to `SoftwareEnvironment`; it writes fixture files and must not be pointed at valuable user data.

The authenticated local workbench accepts this body at `POST /api/run`:

```json
{"case_id":"C07","method_id":"M01","variant":"nominal","seed":40000,"parameters":{"max_steps":16}}
```

Use the local bearer token and poll `GET /api/events?run_id=<returned-id>&after=0`. See [the executable API procedure](../cases.md#authenticated-local-api). A request acknowledgement is not a completed episode.

## Failure evidence and interpretation limits

Termination/wait errors produce explicit runtime failures. If the child reaches its delayed write first, absence verification fails even if it is later stopped. Distinguish this family-level `cancel` tool from the broker's asynchronous intent-cancellation API; both exist, but they are different operations.

Windows uses Job admission and POSIX uses an owned process group for cooperating workers. These controls manage lifecycle, not privileges. The fixed worker does not exercise service-mediated activation, hostile breakaway, all descendant patterns, or every OS scheduling condition; separate process tests cover selected descendant races.

Retain failed, denied, unknown and step-limit outcomes. Native `effect_unknown` retains its lease until independent reconciliation. A task predicate, a tool receipt and a model score answer different questions.
